        <h1> Preface </h1>
        <p>
            The last few years have seen a dramatic upsurge in research in end user programming. Much of this
renewed interest is due to the popularity of the Web. The Web browser is rapidly replacing the
personal computer’s desktop as the platform for many computer activities, and users can now find
information, make purchases, and communicate with each other through a Web browser.
As Chapter 1 explains, the Web browser has turned out to be an ideal platform for end user programming.
Researchers and students at a variety of institutions have been exploring how Web browsers
can be changed or augmented to better support everyday users’ tasks. Some of these systems
have even been released for public use. Unfortunately, there was no common community linking
researchers in this area together. As a result, there was relatively little collaboration between different
groups and papers describing work in this area were published in a variety of different academic
venues. Not only was this hurting the productivity of the field, but it was preventing the potential
beneficiaries, such as Web users and developers, from accessing these technologies. As researchers
working this area ourselves, the four of us felt that it was time to foster a community for researchers in
end user programming on the Web.

        <h2 id="primo">“End-User Programming on the Web” workshop at ACM SIGCHI</h2>
        <p>
            We began by organizing a workshop at the SIGCHI conference (ACM Conference on Human
Factors in Computing Systems) in April 2009. The goals of this workshop were three-fold: (1) to bring
together researchers from a variety of institutions and establish a sense of community, (2) to discuss
common problems and share lessons from our work, and (3) to plan the publication of an edited book
on this topic. The goal of the book was to make it easy for researchers to read about the latest
approaches and innovations in the field and to make this interesting topic more readily available
to a larger audience.
The one-day workshop was attended by 32 participants representing 20 different institutions
across three continents (Asia, Europe, and North America). Participants were selected based on short
position papers that were submitted in advance of the workshop. We personally invited a number of
people to submit position papers on the basis of their previously published work, and we also conducted
an open call for position papers from the research community at large. The authors of all submissions
related to end user programming on the Web were invited to attend the workshop, with the
condition that attendees were also required to prepare a book chapter by our prespecified deadlines.
We began the workshop with each participant giving a one-minute talk about their work in the space
of end user programming on the Web. We then asked five attendees to give longer presentations covering
some of the key projects and areas of interest to our research community. The remainder of the
workshop was spent alternating between break-out groups and full-group discussion in areas of interest
to our research community and specific topics regarding the book. Several of these breakout sessions
were instrumental in helping us establish a coherent organization for the book.
